Code samples demonstrated in a video that is not yet published.

## How to run
Before running the application, start the [Apache Camel SOAP server with Spring Boot](../camel-sb-soap-server-example/) as it is described in its [Readme.md](../camel-sb-soap-server-example/Readme.md).
After the SOAP server is started, you can either run the application inside your IDE by yourself or use the following maven command:
```shell script
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
